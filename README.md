Hey, I'm Jamie
Tanna (he/him/his) üëã

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at [Elastic](https://elastic.co/), and I'm currently based in Nottingham.

I have a [/now page](https://www.jvt.me/now/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna), which aims to be a more up-to-date about page.

I use my [personal website](https://www.jvt.me/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna) as a method of blogging about my learnings, as well as sharing information about projects I have previously, or am currently, working on in my spare time.

I maintain [a number of Open Source projects](https://www.jvt.me/open-source/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna), and primarily use [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/jamietanna) for my source control, but also use [GitHub](https://github.com/jamietanna) for some things.

I write a fair bit on my blog:


- [_Turning on Caps Lock when the Caps Lock key is bound to a different key_](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2023/08/25/caps-lock-linux-rebound/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna)
- [_Setting up real-time Slack notifications for GitHub_](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2023/08/23/github-slack-notifications/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna)
- [_Managing Buildkite Agent Images with Renovate_](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2023/08/22/renovate-buildkite-images/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna)

I blog as a form of documentation, as noted in my post [Blogumentation - Writing Blog Posts as a Method of Documentation](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2017/06/25/blogumentation/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna):

I track articles and resources that I recommend I/others read [as bookmarks on my site](https://www.jvt.me/kind/bookmarks/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna), the latest of which are:


- [_Revitalizing stalled open source projects - Kurt McKee_](https://kurtmckee.org/2023/08/revitalizing-stalled-open-source-projects/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna)

I also write Week Notes as a way of summarising what's going on in my life. The last one can be found at [Week Notes 23#33](https://www.jvt.me/week-notes/2023/33/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna).

---

I like to track my data in [IndieWeb fashion](https://indieweb.org/why). For instance, the last book I read was _Working in Public : The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software_ by Nadia Eghbal, and yesterday, I took 11900 steps.

This is an [autogenerated README](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2022/01/12/autogenerated-profile-readme/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna), which is [automagically deployed using GitHub Actions](https://github.com/jamietanna/jamietanna/blob/main/.github/workflows/rebuild.yml).

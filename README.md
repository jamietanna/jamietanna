Hey, I'm Jamie Tanna (he/him/his) ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently between jobs, and I'm currently based in Nottingham.

I have a [/now page](https://www.jvt.me/now/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna), which aims to be a more up-to-date about page.

I use my [personal website](https://www.jvt.me/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna) as a method of blogging about my learnings, as well as sharing information about projects I have previously, or am currently, working on in my spare time.

I maintain [a number of Open Source projects](https://www.jvt.me/open-source/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna), and primarily use [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/jamietanna) for my source control, but also use [GitHub](https://github.com/jamietanna) for some things.

I write a fair bit on my blog:


- [_Generating a Go HTTP Client from OpenAPI schemas_](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2022/04/06/generate-go-client-openapi/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna)
- [_Generating Go structs from OpenAPI schemas_](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2022/04/06/generate-go-struct-openapi/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna)
- [_Setting up GitLab CI for Go projects_](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2022/04/06/go-gitlab-ci/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna)

I blog as a form of documentation, as noted in my post [Blogumentation - Writing Blog Posts as a Method of Documentation](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2017/06/25/blogumentation/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna):

I track articles and resources that I recommend I/others read [as bookmarks on my site](https://www.jvt.me/kind/bookmarks/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna), the latest of which are:


- [_https://blog.cloudflare.com/pipefail-how-a-missing-shell-option-slowed-cloudflare-down/_](https://blog.cloudflare.com/pipefail-how-a-missing-shell-option-slowed-cloudflare-down/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna)

I also write Week Notes as a way of summarising what's going on in my life. The last one can be found at [Week Notes 22#13](https://www.jvt.me/week-notes/2022/13/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna).

I like to track my data in [IndieWeb fashion](https://indieweb.org/why). For instance, the last book I read was _Zak George's Dog Training Revolution The Complete Guide to Raising the Perfect Pet with Love_ by Zak George and Dina Roth Port, and yesterday, I took 3407 steps.

This is an [autogenerated README](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2022/01/12/autogenerated-profile-readme/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna), which is [automagically deployed using GitHub Actions](https://github.com/jamietanna/jamietanna/blob/main/.github/workflows/rebuild.yml).

Hey, I'm Jamie
Tanna (he/him/his) ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at [Elastic](https://elastic.co/), and I'm currently based in Nottingham.

I have a [/now page](https://www.jvt.me/now/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna), which aims to be a more up-to-date about page.

If you're looking at how best to work with me, you may want to read my [Manual of Me](https://manual.jvt.me/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna).

I use my [personal website](https://www.jvt.me/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna) as a method of blogging about my learnings, as well as sharing information about projects I have previously, or am currently, working on in my spare time.

Right now, my two biggest Open Source side projects are [dependency-management-data](https://dmd.tanna.dev) and [`oapi-codegen`](https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/), and the SAAS platform [deps.fyi](https://deps.fyi).

As well as them, I maintain [a number of other Open Source projects](https://www.jvt.me/open-source/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna), and primarily use [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/jamietanna) for my source control, but also use [GitHub](https://github.com/jamietanna) for some things.

You may also know me for being very public with [sharing my salary history publicly](https://www.jvt.me/salary/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna).

I write a fair bit on my blog:


- [_Generating Go code from JSON Schema documents_](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2025/06/05/json-schema-go/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna)
- [_Creating cross-compiled Docker images from Go binaries_](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2025/06/04/go-cross-compile-docker/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna)

I blog as a form of documentation, as noted in my post [Blogumentation - Writing Blog Posts as a Method of Documentation](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2017/06/25/blogumentation/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna):

I also write Week Notes as a way of summarising what's going on in my life. The last one can be found at [Week Notes 25#23](https://www.jvt.me/week-notes/2025/23/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna).

I like to track my data in [IndieWeb fashion](https://indieweb.org/why). For instance, the last book I read was _From Project to Profit_ by Heather Meeker, and yesterday, I took 2840 steps.

This is an [autogenerated README](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2022/01/12/autogenerated-profile-readme/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna), which is [automagically deployed using GitHub Actions](https://github.com/jamietanna/jamietanna/blob/main/.github/workflows/rebuild.yml).

Hey, I'm Jamie
Tanna (he/him/his) ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at [Deliveroo](https://deliveroo.engineering/), and I'm currently based in Nottingham.

I have a [/now page](https://www.jvt.me/now/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna), which aims to be a more up-to-date about page.

I use my [personal website](https://www.jvt.me/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna) as a method of blogging about my learnings, as well as sharing information about projects I have previously, or am currently, working on in my spare time.

I maintain [a number of Open Source projects](https://www.jvt.me/open-source/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna), and primarily use [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/jamietanna) for my source control, but also use [GitHub](https://github.com/jamietanna) for some things.

I write a fair bit on my blog:


- [_Week Notes 23#17_](https://www.jvt.me/week-notes/2023/17/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna)
- [_Week Notes 23#16_](https://www.jvt.me/week-notes/2023/16/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna)
- [_Getting the commit author details for a GitHub App account_](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2023/04/20/github-app-email-address/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna)

I blog as a form of documentation, as noted in my post [Blogumentation - Writing Blog Posts as a Method of Documentation](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2017/06/25/blogumentation/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna):


- [_Getting the commit author details for a GitHub App account_](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2023/04/20/github-app-email-address/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna)
- [_Generating Equal methods for Go structs with goderive_](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2023/03/27/go-generate-equal-goderive/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna)

I track articles and resources that I recommend I/others read [as bookmarks on my site](https://www.jvt.me/kind/bookmarks/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna), the latest of which are:


- [_Just Simply | Stop saying how simple things are in our docs_](https://justsimply.dev/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna)

I also write Week Notes as a way of summarising what's going on in my life. The last one can be found at [Week Notes 23#17](https://www.jvt.me/week-notes/2023/17/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna).

I like to track my data in [IndieWeb fashion](https://indieweb.org/why). For instance, the last book I read was _It Didn't Start with You How Inherited Family Trauma Shapes Who We Are and How to End the Cycle_ by Mark Wolyn, and yesterday, I took 10712 steps.

This is an [autogenerated README](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2022/01/12/autogenerated-profile-readme/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna), which is [automagically deployed using GitHub Actions](https://github.com/jamietanna/jamietanna/blob/main/.github/workflows/rebuild.yml).

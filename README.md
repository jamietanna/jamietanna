Hey, I'm Jamie
Tanna (he/him/his) ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at [Elastic](https://elastic.co/), and I'm currently based in Nottingham.

I have a [/now page](https://www.jvt.me/now/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna), which aims to be a more up-to-date about page.

I use my [personal website](https://www.jvt.me/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna) as a method of blogging about my learnings, as well as sharing information about projects I have previously, or am currently, working on in my spare time.

Right now, my two biggest side projects are [dependency-management-data](https://dmd.tanna.dev) and [`oapi-codegen`](https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/).

As well as them, I maintain [a number of other Open Source projects](https://www.jvt.me/open-source/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna), and primarily use [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/jamietanna) for my source control, but also use [GitHub](https://github.com/jamietanna) for some things.

I write a fair bit on my blog:


- [_My workflow for writing SQL(ite) queries (2024 edition)_](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2024/06/07/sql-workflow/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna)
- [_Week Notes 24#22_](https://www.jvt.me/week-notes/2024/22/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna)
- [_Calculating the GitHub API's sha representation of a local file_](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2024/05/30/github-sha/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna)

I blog as a form of documentation, as noted in my post [Blogumentation - Writing Blog Posts as a Method of Documentation](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2017/06/25/blogumentation/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna):

I track articles and resources that I recommend I/others read [as bookmarks on my site](https://www.jvt.me/kind/bookmarks/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna), the latest of which are:


- [_Why, after 8 years, I still like GraphQL sometimes in the right context_](https://www.magiroux.com/eight-years-of-graphql?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna)

I also write Week Notes as a way of summarising what's going on in my life. The last one can be found at [Week Notes 24#22](https://www.jvt.me/week-notes/2024/22/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna).

I like to track my data in [IndieWeb fashion](https://indieweb.org/why). For instance, the last book I read was _From Project to Profit_ by Heather Meeker, and yesterday, I took 6743 steps.

This is an [autogenerated README](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2022/01/12/autogenerated-profile-readme/?utm_campaign=github-jamietanna), which is [automagically deployed using GitHub Actions](https://github.com/jamietanna/jamietanna/blob/main/.github/workflows/rebuild.yml).
